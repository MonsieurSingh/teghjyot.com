				Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
				Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated
				they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics,
				a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their
				place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
				paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly
				into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control
				about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One
				day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem
				Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big
				Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of
				bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the
				Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia,
				put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When
				she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a
				last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove,
				the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own
				road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her
				cheek.

				The European languages are members of the same family. Their
				separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc,
				Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in
				their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words.
				Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable:
				one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this,
				it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and
				more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of
				the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of
				the individual languages. The new common language will be more
				simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will
				be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To
				an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a
				skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental
				is.The European languages are members of the same family. Their

				A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul,
				like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole
				heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot,
				which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so
				happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of
				mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be
				incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and
				yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When,
				while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
				meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
				foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the
				inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the
				trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand
				unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the
				little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the
				countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I
				feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own
				image, and the breath

				One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he
				found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He
				lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little
				he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by
				arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover
				it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs,
				pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved
				about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he
				thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
				although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four
				familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out
				on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it
				there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an
				illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It
				showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat
				upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her
				lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the
				window at the dull weather.

				But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
				denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give
				you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
				teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
				of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
				itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
				know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences
				that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves
				or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is
				pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
				and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
				example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
				exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has
				any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a
				pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a
				pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we
				denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
				beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
				moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee.
